					<p>In China, the average life expectancy is 75.8 years. The annual per capita disposable income reached 114700 yuan. China's average life span and per capita disposable income are in the middle level. </p>
					<p>if you are not in China, you are most likely to have two changes:</br><strong>1： Get longer and have more money</strong></br><strong>2： Get shorter and have less money.</strong></br>Because most of the countries are in these two regions. To some extent, the amount of money is positively related to life expectancy </p>
					<p>But there are other possibilities. For example, if you get the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, your annual disposable income is 20000 yuan more, but your life expectancy will be reduced by nearly 11 years!</p>
					<p>And if you are in Afghanistan, not in China, your life expectancy will be reduced by the most, by 23.7 years, "20 years less" is really possible. At the same time, your annual decrease in disposable income there is also relatively high, reaching 14700 yuan</p>
					<p>Tips:</br>Want to live the longest → principality of Monaco (Europe), life expectancy increased by 13.6 years 
					   </br>Want to live the shortest → Afghanistan (Asia), life expectancy reduced by 23.7 years
					      </br>Want to have the most money in hand → the Principality of Liechtenstein (Europe), income increased 122400
					      </br>Want to have the least money in hand → Burundi (Africa) and the Central African Republic (Africa), revenues are reduced by 16 thousand.</p>

					<p>Of course, in a country with more money, you are not necessarily carefree. You may become the unemployed in that country. The unemployment risk has nothing to do with the life span and the amount of money in the region</p>
					
					<p>China's unemployment rate is 3.9%, and the unemployment risk is at a low level internationally</p>
					<p>For example, in Qatar, an Asian country with an income increase of 107400 and a life expectancy increase of 3.2 years, your unemployment risk has increased by 128%, which means 8.9% of the people in the whole country are unemployed.</p>
					<p>Looking at the whole picture, we can see that the area of red circle is generally larger than that of blue circle, that is to say, as long as the unemployment rate is higher than that of China, it will be much higher than that of China; by comparison, the unemployment rate of countries that are lower than that of China is not much lower than that of China.</p>

					<p>Although the unemployment rate has nothing to do with life span and disposable income, the ability to access the Internet has something to do with it.</p>
					<p><strong>In places with longer lifespan and more money, the proportion of Internet users is also higher, which is closely related to the development of the country.</strong></p>
					<p>In countries where life expectancy and disposable income are similar to China's, the proportion of Internet users is also similar.</p>
					<p>The proportion of Internet users in China is 53.2%, about 730 million. Seeing this article shows that you are lucky to be among the half of the people who can access the Internet</p>

				 <p>Some people say, "just look at the computer does not move, not grow fat is not good." this sentence and the word " Fat nerd " have the same wonderful. In people's impression, it seems that people who eat well and stay at home and watch computers are the most likely to be obese. However, this is not the case. "Whether you have money or not, whether you can access the Internet or not, people who should be fat will still be fat." fortunately, this sentence does not apply to China.</p>
				 <p>The obesity rate of Chinese adults is 6.2%, which is very low in the world. The obesity rate in most countries in the world is much higher than that in China. If you are in the Republic of Nauru, your risk of obesity will increase by 884%. This country is the smallest island country in the world, but it is the "fattest" country in the world, with a national obesity rate of 61%.</p>
				 <p>The world's thinnest country is Vietnam, with a national obesity rate of only 2.1%. If you are in Vietnam instead of China, your risk of obesity will be reduced by 66%.</p>
					<p>Note: in the world, the body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 is considered as obesity (calculation formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m) square).</p>

				<div id="xianjie"><p>The above is an exploration of lives in 233 countries from the perspective of quality of life. What about the cost of living in these countries?</p>
				<p>Water is the source of life, the following is to see where consumption is the most "not worth" with "buying water" as a breakthrough</p></div>

					<p><strong>Shopping in China is really affordable.</strong></p>
					<p>Prices are uneven all over the world, and the same amount of RMB can buy different things in different places.</p>
					<p>The average price of a bottle of 0.33l mineral water in China is 1.96 yuan, but when it comes to other places, the cost of buying water generally increases. The most expensive one is even 23.2 yuan. New Caledonia is an overseas dependency of France and one of the famous tourist attractions. Be careful with your wallet when you go there.</p>
					<p>Water in foreign countries is so expensive. How many bottles of water can you buy after you go abroad?</p></div>

				<div id="zuihou"><p>In more than half of the countries, China can only buy less than half a bottle of water for one bottle of water, and even in many regions, such as New Caledonia mentioned above, you can only buy "one mouthful" of water.</p>
				<p>The most "cost-effective" country to buy water is the people's Republic of Bangladesh, which means that water is the cheapest here. This is a country in South Asia, one of the countries with the highest population density and the poorest in the world, and the national price is generally low.</p>
				<p>Of course, the income level of each country is related to its consumption level. </p>
				<p>As a country with a long life span, a middle per capita disposable income, a low unemployment rate, a low cost of living, a small threat of obesity and a high probability of surfing the Internet, China has relatively brought a better living environment for Chinese people. Since the reform and opening up 40 years ago, China has been developing at a "running" pace, and our life will be better and better in the future.</p>
				<p>Finally, no matter where you are, 233 countries and regions in the world have their own characteristics. No matter where you live, the most important thing is to adhere to your own beliefs</p>
